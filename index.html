Exactly what I searched for. Somebody did a faulty commit and t
 "correct" one or the one before that and re-do all the changes 
 done by the last correct one? – elysch Mar 28 '16 at 15:19

Exactly what I need. I've pushed a branch to master by

 all commits history. I just done git push -f for last correct
  commit and remote history cleaned up! Thanks! – Anton Rybalko
